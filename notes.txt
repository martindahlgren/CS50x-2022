A dating website.

After logging in you are shown 4 profiles. Select which ones you want to talk with and click Next.

You get to know when there is a new match and then you can chat. You also get to know how many that person selected :) I.e. if they just click on everyone or if you are special.

Every day at 6 PM (local timezone) new people appear if you were logged in some time the last 24h.

All annan web
Algoritmen för matchingar :( :( :( (detta är nog svårt!)



APIs:
UploadPicture() # Upload a profile picture
GetMatches() # Returns all the chats, including the most recent message of each, user_id of the chat etc
GetChat(user_id) # Returns all messages in chat. Each message has an index
SendChat(user_id, message) # Send a message to a match
GetMoreChat(user_id, idx) # Returns next available message after the idx. After 10 seconds the server will close the connection if nothing comes in. The client can try again.
GetSwipes(user_id) # Returns profiles, or the information how many hours you need to wait (expiry point in UTC)
SendSwipes([user_id]) # Which ones the user said yes to. Server will check that these are the currently possible swipes.
GetMyProfile()
GetProfile(user_id)
SetProfile(...)
UmatchUser(user_id) # Block a user - will delete chat, only accepted if you have a match, this is irreversible
SuggestCities(partial_name) - filter names on possible cities

DB Models:

User (lastactive)
Pairing(is_blocked, a, b), created when the users get the possibility to swipe on each other
ChatMessage (content, Pair, sender, receiver, id)





Note: cities500.zip from https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/            : all cities with a population > 500 or seats of adm div down to PPLA4 (ca 185.000), see 'geoname' table for columns

TODO: Make a singleton class that handles the cities, done!


How things work:

Every day (GMT), a new set of pairs are generated. If the user logs in that day they can see the choices they have for that day. After logging in they have to wait until the new set to pick one.
